<span class="s0">ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY 
====================================== 
 
Ignored Files: 
-------------- 
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you 
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if 
so manually move them: 
 
* ic_launcher-web.png 
* proguard-project.txt 
 
Replaced Jars with Dependencies: 
-------------------------------- 
The importer recognized the following .jar files as third party 
libraries and replaced them with Gradle dependencies instead. This has 
the advantage that more explicit version information is known, and the 
libraries can be updated automatically. However, it is possible that 
the .jar file in your project was of an older version than the 
dependency we picked, which could render the project not compileable. 
You can disable the jar replacement in the import wizard and try again: 
 
android-support-v4.jar =&gt; com.android.support:support-v4:20.0.0 
 
Replaced Libraries with Dependencies: 
------------------------------------- 
The importer recognized the following library projects as third party 
libraries and replaced them with Gradle dependencies instead. This has 
the advantage that more explicit version information is known, and the 
libraries can be updated automatically. However, it is possible that 
the source files in your project were of an older version than the 
dependency we picked, which could render the project not compileable. 
You can disable the library replacement in the import wizard and try 
again: 
 
appcompat-v7 =&gt; [com.android.support:appcompat-v7:20.0.0] 
 
Moved Files: 
------------ 
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT 
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured: 
 
* AndroidManifest.xml =&gt; app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml 
* assets\ =&gt; app\src\main\assets\ 
* res\ =&gt; app\src\main\res\ 
* src\ =&gt; app\src\main\java\ 
 
Next Steps: 
----------- 
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network 
connectivity to download dependencies. 
 
Bugs: 
----- 
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that 
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer, 
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category 
Component-Tools. 
 
(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted 
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
